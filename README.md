The code for the different platforms is in different states and under continuous development. 
All code comes with test functions. Please find the details below.

Python

No installation is required beyond Python3 and standard packages. 
The code is incomplete in the sense that certain basis functions are still missing and that some serious bugs have not been solved yet. 
There is an example from the 2018-book that illustrates one of those bugs.
The Python code is under most active development.

C++

Requires OpenCV-libraries (>2.4) and Cython (for the Python-wrapper).
The code is in beta3, fairly complete and documented.
If you discover any bugs, please report or correct by pull-request.
The C++ code is under use and is updated occasionally. The Python-wrapper will only be bug-fixed on request.

Matlab

Requires Matlab at unknown version.
The code is fairly complete and documented.
If you discover any bugs, please report or correct by pull-request.
The Matlab code is not under use any more.
