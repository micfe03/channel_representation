  Unified channel encoding toolbox v1.0
  -------------------------------------

    This toolbox is a restructuring and unification of pieces of code 
    produced by several authors. It would not be possible to list one
    author for every source file. The whole toolbox should instead be
    seen as a group effort.

    Most of the original code upon which this toolbox is based can be 
    found in the 'semi_obsolete' directory. It is labelled semi_obsolete
    because it still contains some functions that are not inlcuded in
    the general class structure - e.g. gaussinan channels and ND-decoding.

    Here is an attempt to give proper credits for various pieces
    of the code:

    cos2 encoding and decoding: 
      Per-Erik Forssen 
        (Also released as part of "Channel Learning Architecture toolbox"
         by Per-Erik Forssen, Gösta Granlund, Björn Johansson)

    B-spline encoding and decoding:
      Michael Felsberg and Per-Erik Forssen

    P-channel encoding and decoding:
      Michael Felsberg and Erik Jonsson

    Fast piecewise polynomial implementation:
      Michael Felsberg, Johan Hedborg, Erik Jonsson

    Class structure, editing and unification:
      Erik Jonsson
