%CompoundChannelEnc/decode
%
% Decoding ND representations like this is not trivial. There are some 
% decoders available for single-layer outer-product encodings in the 
% 'decoding' directory, but they are not supported by this class, since 
% they are not systematically available for several encodings. 
%
% In order to decode multilayer things, locate your favourite decoder
% manually (or add a special case to this function that makes decoding
% some certain special case possible)
